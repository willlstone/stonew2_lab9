Websys Quiz 1

My projects page is pretty bare because I mostly focused on the technical stuff so I hope that is okay.

Everything suprisingly worked out though, my only real concern is with the .htaccess file. Because on my machine, with my apache running this runs fine, but I really don't know how .htaccess files work and the internet was not making life much easier in regards to that. I was under the impression after the review session Corey hosted that the .htaccess file would be something as simple as "Options +Indexes /n Require All Granted"... but I don't see how that would make this run on somebody else's machine without my vhosts file. So I ended up just throwing the meat and potatoes of my vhosts files into the .htaccess file and I'm paranoid that's not what you wanted.  I just don't want that one thing to ruin my grade for this quiz. 

Also I hope it is okay I just threw my Javascript into my HTML file instead of linking an additional file, there wasn't that much code and I didn't think it made it significanly messier.
